paragraph_1:
William Oughtred (1574-1660) contributed vastly to the
propagation of mathematical knowledge in English by his
treatises, The Clavis Mathematicae, 1631, published in
Latin (English edition 1647), Circles of Proportion, 1632,
and Trigonometrie, 1657. Oughtred laid extraordinary
emphasis upon the use of mathematical symbols, altogether
he used over 150 of them. Three have survived to the
modern times, namely the cross symbol for multiplication,
:: as that of proportion, and the symbol for "difference
between".

paragraph_2:
DIGIT The word digit refers both to the fingers (and toes)
as well as the Arabic number symbols for 0 to 9. The root is
the Indo-European word, deik and is related to many other
words that reflect the use of the hands and fingers to
"point" out objects. Index, indicate, dictate, indict, token,
dice, judge and teach are all related to the same root.

paragraph_3:
Leibniz (1646-1715) had serious, logical doubts and
reservations to the use of Oughtred's cross symbol because
of possible confusion with the letter X. On 29 July 1698 he
wrote in a letter to John Bernoulli : "I do not like (the cross)
as a symbol for multiplication, as it is easily confounded
with x; .... often I simply relate two quantities by an.

paragraph_4:
THOUSAND Our number for one thousand comes from an
extension of hundred. The roots are from the Germanic
roots teue and hundt. Teue refers to a thickening or
swelling, and hundt is the root of our present day hundred.
A thousand, then, literally means a swollen or large
hundred. The root teue is the basis of such common words
today as thigh, thumb, tumor, and tuber.
